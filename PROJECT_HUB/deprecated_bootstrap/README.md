  Archive of deprecated bootstrap documents moved here on 2025-09-15 to prevent confusion.
  These documents are NO LONGER VALID and kept only for historical reference. The ONLY
  valid bootstrap document is PROJECT_HUB/SINGLE_ENTRY.md. These files caused confusion
  for new LLM instances and have been moved here as part of the final cleanup.

# ⚠️ DEPRECATED BOOTSTRAP DOCUMENTS ⚠️

## DO NOT USE THESE DOCUMENTS

These files have been moved here from PROJECT_HUB root to prevent confusion.

### Why These Files Exist
- Historical artifacts from before bootstrap consolidation
- Previously competing initialization protocols
- Caused "widersprüchliche Bootstrap-Dokumentation" confusion

### The ONLY Valid Bootstrap
```
PROJECT_HUB/SINGLE_ENTRY.md
```

### Files in This Archive
1. **START_HERE_LLM.md** - Old confused router (DEPRECATED)
2. **HAK_GAL_UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md** - Old decentralized approach (DEPRECATED)
3. **PROJECT_HUB_LLM_INITIATION_PROTOCOL_PHLIP.md** - Old centralized approach (DEPRECATED)

### Historical Context
- Before 2025-09-15: Three competing bootstrap protocols
- 2025-09-15: Consolidated to SINGLE_ENTRY.md
- 2025-09-15: Moved deprecated files here

### If You Found This Folder
You're probably investigating system history. That's good! But remember:
- These documents are NOT operational
- They contain OUTDATED information
- They should NEVER be used for initialization
- Go to SINGLE_ENTRY.md immediately
