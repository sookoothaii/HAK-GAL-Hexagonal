# Nightly Trend Analysis Setup

## Purpose
Automated monitoring of Knowledge Base composition and migration readiness through daily stratified sampling.

## Implementation

### Daily Dry-Run Command
```bash
# Recommended nightly analysis (500 lines stratified sampling)
hak-gal:bulk_translate_predicates(
    dry_run=true,
    limit=500,
    mapping={"HatZweck": "HasPurpose", "HatTeil": "HasPart"},
    report_path="PROJECT_HUB/reports/nightly_trend_YYYYMMDD.md",
    sample_strategy="stratified"
)
```

### Current Baseline (2025-08-14)
- **Total KB Size:** 3,781 facts
- **Sample Size:** 500 lines (13.2% coverage)
- **German→English Migration Potential:** 190 changes detected
  - HatTeil → HasPart: 96 potential changes
  - HatZweck → HasPurpose: 94 potential changes
- **Distribution:** Balanced stratified sampling across entire KB

### Monitoring Metrics
1. **Change Volume Trends:** Track daily potential migration counts
2. **Predicate Distribution:** Monitor HatTeil vs HatZweck ratio evolution
3. **KB Growth Rate:** Correlate with daily growth statistics
4. **Migration Readiness:** Assess optimal timing for large-scale migrations

### Automation Options
- **Scheduled Task:** Daily execution at off-peak hours
- **Report Archival:** Automatic timestamped report generation
- **Trend Analysis:** Weekly comparison of daily reports
- **Alert System:** Notification for significant changes in patterns

### Benefits
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Early detection of KB composition changes
- **Migration Planning:** Data-driven decisions for predicate migrations
- **Quality Assurance:** Continuous validation of KB consistency
- **Performance Baseline:** Historical data for optimization decisions
