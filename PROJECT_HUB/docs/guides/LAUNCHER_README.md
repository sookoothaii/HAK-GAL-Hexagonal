## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### PowerShell Execution Policy
If you get execution errors:
```powershell
# Allow script execution (run as Admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Or bypass for single run
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\START_ALL_SERVICES.ps1
```

### Custom Port Configuration
Edit the scripts to change ports:
```powershell
# In START_ALL_SERVICES.ps1
$ports = @(5002, 5173, 8088, 5001, 5000)  # Modify as needed
```

### Skip Ollama Check
```powershell
.\START_ALL_SERVICES.ps1 -NoOllama
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
The scripts automatically kill processes on required ports. If issues persist:
```powershell
# Manual port cleanup
netstat -ano | findstr :5002
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
```

### Frontend Not Starting
1. Check if `frontend` directory exists
2. Run `npm install` in frontend directory
3. Check `package.json` for correct scripts

### Service on 8088 Not Found
Create `service_8088.py` in root directory or configure path in script.

### Virtual Environment Issues
Scripts auto-detect `.venv_hexa` or `venv`. If using different name:
```powershell
# Edit in script
$PYTHON = ".\your_venv\Scripts\python.exe"
```

## üìä Health Checks

The main launcher performs automatic health checks:
- ‚úÖ Python environment
- ‚úÖ NPM availability
- ‚úÖ Ollama status
- ‚úÖ Port availability
- ‚úÖ Service responsiveness

## üí° Tips

### Development Workflow
```powershell
# Morning startup
.\START_ALL_SERVICES.ps1

# Quick restart during development
.\STOP_ALL_SERVICES.ps1
.\QUICK_START.ps1

# End of day
.\STOP_ALL_SERVICES.ps1
```

### Production Deployment
Consider using:
- Windows Services for auto-start
- Process managers (PM2, Supervisor)
- Docker containers

### Custom Services
Add your own services by creating:
- `service_8088.py` for port 8088
- Modify scripts to add more ports

---

## üéØ Quick Commands

```powershell
# Start everything
.\START_ALL_SERVICES.ps1

# Stop everything
.\STOP_ALL_SERVICES.ps1

# Check what's running
netstat -an | findstr "5002 5173 8088"

# Open browser manually
start http://localhost:5173
```

## üìù Notes

- Each service runs in its own terminal window
- Closing the launcher window does NOT stop services
- Services continue running until explicitly stopped
- Logs are visible in each service window
