  This directive tasks Claude Opus 4.1 with the creation of four critical documentation packages to resolve gaps identified via deep source code and documentation cross-analysis. The packages cover the autonomous Governor and HRM systems, the Multi-Agent architecture, the hybrid LLM integration strategy, and a canonical onboarding guide for human developers. The goal is to align the project's documentation with its advanced, operative capabilities, thereby improving maintainability, extensibility, and developer velocity.
rationale: "A deep analysis revealed that documentation for the most dynamic and operationally complex system components is missing. This directive provides a concrete action plan to close these gaps."

# Directive for Claude Opus 4.1: Documentation Gap Resolution

## 1. Preamble

This document outlines a series of work packages to address critical gaps in the HAK-GAL HEXAGONAL project documentation. A deep cross-analysis of the live source code and the existing `PROJECT_HUB` structure has revealed that while the foundational architecture is well-documented, several advanced, operative components lack the necessary documentation for maintenance, extension, and onboarding.

Your task is to create the missing documentation as specified below, adhering strictly to the rules and taxonomy defined in `PROJECT_HUB/docs/meta/routing_table.json`.

## 2. Work Package 1: Autonomous & Learning Systems

*   **Objective**: Create comprehensive operational guides for the autonomous Governor and the Human Reasoning Model (HRM / `NativeReasoningEngine`).
*   **Key Questions to Answer**:
    *   **Governor**: How is the Governor configured and calibrated? What are its key parameters? How are its decisions logged and monitored? What is the standard procedure for starting and stopping it safely?
    *   **HRM**: What is the architecture of the `NativeReasoningEngine`? What data is required for its training and retraining (`/api/hrm/retrain`)? What are the steps for a manual retraining cycle? How can the model's performance and accuracy be evaluated over time?
*   **Recommended Documentation**:
    *   Create a new document under `topics: ["guides"]` titled **"Operational Guide: Autonomous Governor & HRM"**.

## 3. Work Package 2: Multi-Agent Architecture

*   **Objective**: Document the Multi-Agent Collaboration Bus and the process for integrating new agents.
*   **Key Questions to Answer**:
    *   What is the high-level architecture of the Agent Bus (`/api/agent-bus/`)?
    *   What is the communication protocol for task delegation and response handling?
    *   Provide a step-by-step guide for creating a new "Agent Adapter" and integrating it into the system.
    *   What are the data contracts and expected interfaces for agents like `cursor`?
*   **Recommended Documentation**:
    *   Create a new document under `topics: ["design_docs"]` titled **"Architecture: Multi-Agent Collaboration Bus"**.
    *   Create a new document under `topics: ["guides"]` titled **"Developer Guide: Integrating a New Agent"**.

## 4. Work Package 3: LLM Integration Strategy

*   **Objective**: Document the hybrid LLM provider strategy and the process for managing LLM integrations.
*   **Key Questions to Answer**:
    *   What is the precise failover logic and priority order of the `MultiLLMProvider` (Groq, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude, Ollama)?
    *   How are API keys and endpoints configured for the different providers?
    *   What is the standard procedure for adding a new LLM provider to the hybrid chain?
    *   How can the performance and cost of different LLMs be monitored?
*   **Recommended Documentation**:
    *   Create a new document under `topics: ["guides"]` titled **"Guide: LLM Provider Management & Integration"**.

## 5. Work Package 4: Canonical Developer Onboarding

*   **Objective**: Create a single, authoritative guide for new human developers to set up the complete development environment from scratch.
*   **Key Questions to Answer**:
    *   What are the system prerequisites (Python version, Node.js version, OS, etc.)?
    *   Provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire setup process:
        1.  Cloning the repository.
        2.  Setting up the Python virtual environment (`venv`) and installing `requirements.txt`.
        3.  Setting up the frontend dependencies (`npm install`).
        4.  Configuring all necessary environment variables and API keys in the `.env` file.
        5.  Initializing the SQLite database (`hexagonal_kb.db`).
        6.  Running all services locally with a single command or script.
*   **Recommended Documentation**:
    *   Create a new, top-level document under `topics: ["guides"]` titled **"Canonical Developer Onboarding Guide"**. This guide should supersede or consolidate information from existing start scripts and manual guides.

## 6. Conclusion

Executing these work packages will significantly enhance the project's maintainability and accessibility. Please ensure all created documents strictly adhere to the frontmatter and content rules enforced by `validate_hub.py`.
