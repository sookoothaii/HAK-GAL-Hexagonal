# HAK-GAL SYSTEM REPAIR REPORT
# =============================
# Generated: 2025-08-21 13:35:00
# Status: CRITICAL - Database Mismatch

## PROBLEM SUMMARY
- **Expected:** hexagonal_kb.db with 5911 facts
- **Frontend shows:** 5005 facts  
- **System searching for:** k_assistant.kb.jsonl (WRONG!)
- **Discrepancy:** -906 facts missing

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
1. System still using LegacyFactRepository despite use_legacy=False
2. Environment variable HAKGAL_SQLITE_DB_PATH not being applied
3. WebSocket connection fails on port 8088 (Caddy not running)

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Status
```
hexagonal_kb.db: 5911 facts (1.54 MB) - CORRECT
k_assistant.db:   4005 facts - OLD/WRONG
k_assistant.kb.jsonl: Not found - Legacy format
```

### Port Configuration
```
5002: HAK-GAL API (should include Governor+Reasoning+WebSocket)
8088: Caddy Proxy (WebSocket relay) - NOT RUNNING
5173: Frontend (Vite)
```

### Trust Metrics (from UI)
```
Neural Confidence:  100% HIGH
Factual Accuracy:   80%
Source Quality:     10%  <-- CRITICAL ISSUE
Model Consensus:    50%
Ethical Alignment:  70%
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **STOP all services:**
   ```batch
   KILL_ALL.bat
   ```

2. **SET environment variable:**
   ```batch
   set HAKGAL_SQLITE_DB_PATH=D:\MCP Mods\HAK_GAL_HEXAGONAL\hexagonal_kb.db
   ```

3. **START with fixed launcher:**
   ```batch
   START_FIXED.bat
   ```

4. **VERIFY with:**
   ```powershell
   .\check_ports.ps1
   .\check_db.ps1
   ```

## FILES MODIFIED
1. START_FIXED.bat - Added Caddy server
2. START_ALL_SERVICES_FIXED.ps1 - Removed Governor on 5001
3. sqlite_adapter.py - Using hexagonal_kb.db
4. Created: KILL_ALL.bat, check_ports.ps1, check_db.ps1

## EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX
- API on 5002 shows 5911 facts
- Frontend displays correct count
- Source Quality increases to >80%
- WebSocket connection stable via Caddy

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
[ ] All services stopped
[ ] Environment variable set
[ ] Services restarted with START_FIXED.bat
[ ] Port 5002 responding
[ ] Port 8088 (Caddy) running
[ ] Frontend shows 5911 facts
[ ] WebSocket connected
[ ] No errors in console
