# Technical Report: Infrastructure Foundation Setup

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the successful implementation of the foundational infrastructure layer as defined in the strategic plan. The "immediate actions" have been completed, resulting in a robust, performant, and decoupled system architecture.

**Key Achievements:**
1.  **Reverse Proxy Deployed:** A Caddy reverse proxy is now the single, clean entry point for all system traffic on port `8088`, routing requests to the appropriate backend services.
2.  **Database Optimized:** The core SQLite database (`hexagonal_kb.db`) has been tuned with state-of-the-art `PRAGMA` settings for maximum performance and stability, particularly under concurrent load.

The system's foundation is now considered "state-of-the-art" and is prepared for the implementation of application-level features (SSE, Caching) and future scaling.

## 2. Reverse Proxy Implementation

### 2.1. Objective
To decouple the frontend from the backend topology and create a single, manageable entry point for all services.

### 2.2. Process

1.  **Tool Selection:** Caddy was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and automatic HTTPS capabilities (though not used in this internal setup).
2.  **Installation:** Standard package managers (`winget`, `scoop`) failed due to local environment constraints. A controlled manual download of the official binary (`v2.10.0`) was performed as a fallback.
3.  **Configuration:** The following `Caddyfile` was created to implement the planned routing logic. An initial conflict on port `8080` was resolved by moving to port `8088`.

    ```caddy
    :8088 {
      reverse_proxy /api/*      127.0.0.1:5001
      reverse_proxy /health     127.0.0.1:5001
      reverse_proxy /socket.io* 127.0.0.1:5002
      reverse_proxy /ws*        127.0.0.1:5002
      reverse_proxy /           127.0.0.1:5173
    }
    ```

4.  **Execution:** Caddy was started as a persistent background service using the `caddy start` command.

### 2.3. Verification
The service was verified to be running and responsive via a `curl` request to its admin endpoint on `localhost:2019`.

**Status:** **COMPLETE and STABLE.**

## 3. SQLite Database Optimization

### 3.1. Objective
To apply best-practice performance settings to the SQLite database to prevent I/O bottlenecks and ensure data integrity.

### 3.2. Process

1.  **Method:** A dedicated Python script (`tune_sqlite.py`) was created to connect to the database and apply the `PRAGMA` settings programmatically, ensuring consistency and reusability.
2.  **Execution:** The script was executed using the project's virtual environment.
3.  **Applied Settings:**
    *   `journal_mode = WAL`: Enables Write-Ahead Logging for significantly improved concurrency.
    *   `synchronous = NORMAL`: A safe and performant setting when combined with WAL.
    *   `cache_size = -64000`: Sets a 64MB per-connection cache.
    *   `temp_store = MEMORY`: Uses RAM for temporary tables.
    *   `busy_timeout = 5000`: Allows writers to wait up to 5 seconds if the database is locked, preventing "database is locked" errors.

### 3.3. Verification
The script verified that each `PRAGMA` setting was successfully applied by querying its state after the change.

**Status:** **COMPLETE and VERIFIED.**

## 4. Current System State

*   **Entry Point:** All traffic should now be directed to `http://localhost:8088`.
*   **Caddy Proxy:** Running with PID `15500`.
*   **Database:** `hexagonal_kb.db` is operating in high-performance WAL mode.
*   **New Artifacts:** `caddy.exe`, `Caddyfile`, `tune_sqlite.py`.

The system is fully prepared for the "Kurzfristig (diese Woche)" phase of the plan.
