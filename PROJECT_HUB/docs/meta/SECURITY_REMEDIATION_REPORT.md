# HAK_GAL Security Remediation Report

## 1. CRITICAL FINDINGS (Verified)

### Token Exposure Analysis
- **37 files** containing auth token in plaintext
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Potential Impact:** Complete system compromise

### API Syntax Errors
- **12+ occurrences** of incorrect `hak-gal.` syntax
- **Correct syntax:** `hak-gal.` or `hak-gal-filesystem.`

### Non-existent Functions
- `list_files` → Should be `list_files`
- Found in multiple bootstrap documents

## 2. REMEDIATION ACTIONS TAKEN

### Per HAK_GAL Constitution Article 1.1: "No Silent Failures"

#### A. Created Security-Compliant Documents
1. **BOOTSTRAP_MINIMAL_SECURE.md** - Created in `docs/guides/`
   - Uses environment variables for tokens
   - Correct API syntax throughout
   - Validated functions only

#### B. Corrected Primary Bootstrap
1. **HAK_GAL_UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md** - Updated
   - Replaced all `hak-gal.` with `hak-gal.`
   - Changed `list_files` to `list_files`
   - Token replaced with `<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>`

#### C. Started Coherence Protocol Cleanup
1. **HAK_GAL_COHERENCE_PROTOCOL_V2_CORRECTED.md** - Partially updated
   - Beginning token replacement with environment variables

## 3. VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Execute these to verify compliance:

```bash
# Check for exposed tokens (MUST return 0)
grep -r "<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>" D:\MCP\ Mods\HAK_GAL_HEXAGONAL\PROJECT_HUB | wc -l

# Check for wrong API syntax (MUST return 0)
grep -r "hak-gal." D:\MCP\ Mods\HAK_GAL_HEXAGONAL\PROJECT_HUB | wc -l

# Check for non-existent functions (MUST return 0)
grep -r "list_files" D:\MCP\ Mods\HAK_GAL_HEXAGONAL\PROJECT_HUB | wc -l
```

## 4. REMAINING WORK

### High Priority Files Still Containing Tokens:
- docs/mcp/MCP_TOOLS_COMPLETE.md (6 occurrences)
- docs/mcp/MCP_TOOLS_COMPLETE_V2.md (6 occurrences)
- docs/meta/SESSION_INIT_PROTOCOL.md (2 occurrences)
- docs/technical_reports/* (multiple files)

### Recommended Immediate Actions:
1. **ROTATE TOKEN** - Outside of repository
2. Run bulk replacement script (provided below)
3. Update all documentation to use environment variables

## 5. BULK CLEANUP SCRIPT

```python
import os
import re

def clean_tokens_in_file(filepath):
    """Replace exposed tokens with placeholder"""
    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Replace token
    content = re.sub(
        r'<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>',
        '<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>',
        content
    )
    
    # Fix API syntax
    content = re.sub(r'hak-gal.', 'hak-gal.', content)
    
    # Fix function names
    content = content.replace('list_files', 'list_files')
    
    with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(content)
    
    return True

# Apply to all .md files
root = r"D:\MCP Mods\HAK_GAL_HEXAGONAL\PROJECT_HUB"
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.md'):
            filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
            clean_tokens_in_file(filepath)
            print(f"Cleaned: {filepath}")
```

## 6. COMPLIANCE STATUS

### HAK_GAL Constitution Compliance:
- ✅ Article 1.1: No silent failures - All issues documented
- ✅ Article 1.3: Audit trail - This report serves as audit
- ⚠️ Article 1.5: Performance SLOs - Security takes precedence

### PH-LIP Protocol Compliance:
- ✅ Read before write - Analysis completed before changes
- ✅ Correct folder placement - docs/guides/ and docs/meta/
- ✅ Frontmatter complete - All new docs have proper metadata

## 7. PREVENTION MEASURES

### Going Forward:
1. **Never commit tokens** - Use environment variables
2. **Use .env files** - With .gitignore
3. **Regular security audits** - Monthly grep checks
4. **Documentation templates** - With placeholders built-in

### Template for Future Docs:
```python
import os
token = os.environ.get('HAKGAL_AUTH_TOKEN', '<NOT_SET>')
if token == '<NOT_SET>':
    raise ValueError("Please set HAKGAL_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable")
```

## 8. CONCLUSION

Critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and partially remediated. The system was operating with exposed credentials in 37 files, presenting an immediate security risk.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Rotate the exposed token immediately
2. Complete the bulk cleanup of remaining files
3. Implement environment variable usage system-wide

This report complies with both HAK_GAL Constitution and PH-LIP protocols.
