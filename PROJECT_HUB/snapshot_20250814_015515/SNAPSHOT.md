# Frontend Analysis & Modernization Roadmap

Comprehensive Frontend Analysis completed. Frontend on port 5173 analyzed with identified issues: data inconsistency (3776 facts in backend vs 220 in frontend config), code organization problems (15+ backup files, duplicate implementations), state fragmentation (4 WebSocket hooks, 3 stores), performance concerns (no virtualization for large lists). Created 5-week modernization roadmap with specific implementation priorities, performance targets, and testing strategy. Frontend uses React 18, TypeScript, Zustand, Vite, and Tailwind CSS - solid foundation but needs systematic refactoring.
