# HAK/GAL AuditLogger Analysis Snapshot\n\n**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-09-09T18:45:00Z  \n**Analysis_ID:** auditlogger_analysis_72cd4f\n\n## Overview\nThis document summarizes the analysis of the `audit_logger.py` implementation in the `application` layer of the HAK/GAL Suite. It verifies how constitutional logging and audit requirements are practically enforced.\n\n## Findings\n\n### 1. Core Design\n- Class: `AuditLogger`.\n- Stores entries in `audit_log.jsonl` at project root.\n- Append-only JSONL format.\n\n### 2. Hash-Chaining\n- Each entry contains:\n  - `ts` — UTC timestamp (ISO 8601).\n  - `event` — event type.\n  - `payload` — arbitrary dict with operator info, evidence, risk refs.\n  - `prev_hash` — hash of previous entry.\n  - `entry_hash` — SHA256 hash of the current entry.\n- Ensures tamper-evident chain: any modification invalidates the chain.\n\n### 3. Implementation Details\n- `_compute_hash()` uses SHA256 over sorted JSON.\n- `log(event, payload)` appends a new entry, links to previous.\n- Loads last entry at init to continue chain.\n- Silent failure handling (`except Exception: pass`).\n\n### 4. Comparison with Constitution v2.2\n- ✅ Append-only storage implemented.\n- ✅ Hash-chaining included.\n- ✅ UTC timestamps.\n- ⚠ Peer review and operator IDs not enforced at logger level (must be in payload).\n- ⚠ Silent failure on exception could undermine audit guarantees.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe AuditLogger provides a **lightweight blockchain-style audit trail**:\n- Immutable append-only logs.\n- Cryptographically verifiable integrity.\n- Minimal design delegates responsibility for payload completeness to callers.\n\nThis confirms compliance with the governance requirements (Art. 12) of the HAK/GAL Constitution v2.2, while leaving potential for future strengthening (e.g. stricter payload validation, failure handling).\n
