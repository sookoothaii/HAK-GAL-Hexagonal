  This report documents the design and implementation of the Inter-Agent Communication
  Protocol, centered around the new `agent_hub` directory. To address the problem of isolated
  LLM instances, a structured, file-based messaging system was created. This involved
  creating a new directory structure, updating the project's routing table (`routing_table.json` v1.3)
  with new `agent_report_*` topics, and fundamentally revising the universal bootstrap
  file (`HAK_GAL_UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md` v1.3) to enforce the new protocol. The system now
  supports robust, asynchronous multi-agent collaboration.

# Report: Implementation of the Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

## 1. Problem Analysis

A deep analysis of the project's bootstrap process revealed a critical gap: while new LLM instances were provided with a comprehensive starting context (`HAK_GAL_UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md`), they lacked a mechanism to discover new tasks or review the work products of other AI agents generated after their own initialization. This created isolated instances, unable to collaborate effectively or understand the project's evolving state.

## 2. Solution Architecture: The "Agent Hub"

To solve this, a file-based, asynchronous communication and tasking system named the "Agent Hub" was designed and implemented. This system provides a persistent, transparent, and scalable method for inter-agent collaboration.

The implementation consisted of three phases:

### 2.1. Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation

A new primary directory was created at `PROJECT_HUB/agent_hub/`. Within this hub, dedicated subdirectories (or "niches") were established for each primary AI agent:

*   `agent_hub/gemini/`
*   `agent_hub/claude/`
*   `agent_hub/deepseek/`
*   `agent_hub/system/` (For automated reports from the HAK-GAL system itself)

This structure provides a clear, organized space for each agent to deposit its work products.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Formalization via Routing Table

The new architecture was formalized by updating the project's central routing rules in `PROJECT_HUB/docs/meta/routing_table.json` to version 1.3. The following `agent_report_*` topics were added to the `routing_table` and `definitions` sections:

*   `agent_report_gemini`: Maps to `agent_hub/gemini/`
*   `agent_report_claude`: Maps to `agent_hub/claude/`
*   `agent_report_deepseek`: Maps to `agent_hub/deepseek/`
*   `agent_report_system`: Maps to `agent_hub/system/`

This ensures that all agent-generated reports are correctly classified and validated by the `validate_hub.py` script, fully integrating them into the project's knowledge management system.

### 2.3. Phase 3: Process Integration via Bootstrap Protocol

The most critical change was the fundamental revision of the `HAK_GAL_UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md` file to version 1.3. The previous static content was replaced with a mandatory, multi-step start protocol. This protocol instructs every new LLM instance to:

1.  **Actively search for global directives** in `docs/design_docs/`.
2.  **Review the work of other agents** by listing the contents of their respective `agent_hub` directories.
3.  **Deposit its own completed work** as a new report in its own `agent_hub` niche, using the appropriate `agent_report_*` topic.

## 3. Outcome

The HAK-GAL system now possesses a robust and scalable protocol for multi-agent collaboration. The problem of isolated instances is resolved. Any new LLM instance that correctly follows the v1.3 bootstrap protocol will be fully aware of the project's current state and its own role within the collaborative ecosystem. This report is the first document to be created following this new protocol.
